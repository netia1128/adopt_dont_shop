**MVC Principals**
Admin_Applications_Controller#update
  should my conditional logic and updating live here?
    -is this in the right controller? Could it be in ApplicationPet or Application?
    -should it be in a model or controller?
  I only put it where it is because I'm arriving here from the admin_applications#show page


**Autofill on Error**
Error messages - have both javascript required and flash messages,
but following steps outlined in class today did not succeed in auto-filling my form.
Remember to replace required on zip code!

Is it standard practice to name all controllers/routes plural? I.E. admins vs admin
